# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed 🔧

### 1. ✅ Waifu Summoning Error
**Problem:** Getting "Ошибка при призыве: 1" when trying to summon waifus

**Cause:** The `STATS_DISTRIBUTION` dictionary in `data_tables.py` was simplified to just `{"min": 5, "max": 15}` but the code expected it to have individual stat names like `{"power": (5, 15), "charm": (5, 15), ...}`

**Fix:** Restored the proper structure with all 6 stats for each rarity level.

**Commits:**
- `5e3b7d1` - Fix: Restore proper STATS_DISTRIBUTION structure for waifu generation
- `fda2581` - Fix: Add missing EVENTS table back to data_tables.py

### 2. ✅ Custom Images from GitHub
**Problem:** Waifus still showing placeholder DiceBear avatars instead of custom GitHub images

**Cause:** The `WAIFU_IMAGES_BY_RACE` dictionary still had placeholder URLs

**Fix:** Updated all image URLs to use GitHub raw content:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shimmmi/waifu_bot/main/waifu-images/races/[race]/[filename].jpeg
```

**Commits:**
- `54586eb` - Update image URLs to use GitHub hosted custom waifu images
- `71bbb7c` - Add migration script to update existing waifu images to GitHub URLs

## Deployment Status 🚀

### Current State
- ✅ Code fixes pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Image URLs updated to GitHub raw content
- ✅ All 40 custom waifu images committed to repository (5 per race × 8 races)
- ⏳ Render is automatically redeploying (~2-3 minutes)

### What Happens Next

1. **New Waifus** (after deploy):
   - Will automatically use your custom GitHub images
   - Images are selected based on race (Angel, Demon, Vampire, Elf, etc.)

2. **Existing Waifus**:
   - Still have old DiceBear URLs in the database
   - Need to run migration script to update them

## Update Existing Waifus 🖼️

To update existing waifus in the production database with new GitHub images:

### Option 1: Run Migration Script (Recommended)

1. Open `update_images_production.bat`
2. Replace the `DATABASE_URL` with your Neon connection string:
   ```batch
   set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:YOUR_PASSWORD@ep-dry-unit-a6kx0mwq.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```

3. Run the batch file:
   ```cmd
   update_images_production.bat
   ```

### Option 2: Direct SQL Update (Neon SQL Editor)

If you prefer, you can also update images directly in Neon SQL Editor. The migration script does this automatically, but you can also run SQL queries manually.

## Verify the Fixes ✨

### Test Waifu Summoning
1. Open your Telegram bot
2. Use `/start` command
3. Click "🎰 Призвать вайфу"
4. Click "1x Призыв (100 монет)"
5. Should now work without errors!

### Test Custom Images
1. Summon a new waifu (will use GitHub images)
2. Click on the waifu to see detailed info in WebApp
3. Image should show your custom artwork based on the waifu's race

### Test Existing Waifus
1. After running the migration script
2. Open any existing waifu's detailed info
3. Should now show GitHub image instead of DiceBear avatar

## Image Structure 📁

Your images are organized by race:
```
waifu-images/
└── races/
    ├── angel/      (5 images)
    ├── beast/      (5 images)
    ├── demon/      (5 images)
    ├── dragon/     (5 images)
    ├── elf/        (5 images)
    ├── fairy/      (5 images)
    ├── human/      (5 images)
    └── vampire/    (5 images)
```

## Next Steps 🎯

### Immediate (After Deploy Completes)
1. ✅ Wait for Render to finish deploying (~2-3 minutes)
2. ✅ Test waifu summoning - should work now
3. ✅ Run migration script to update existing waifus
4. ✅ Test that images appear correctly

### Future Enhancements
- Add profession-specific images (optional)
- Add nationality-specific images (optional)
- Add more images per category for variety

## Troubleshooting 🔍

### If summoning still fails:
- Check Render logs for any deployment errors
- Verify the deploy completed successfully
- Try restarting the Render service manually

### If images don't show:
- Verify your GitHub repository is public
- Check that image file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Test GitHub raw content URLs directly in browser
- Make sure you ran the migration script for existing waifus

### If migration script fails:
- Check that DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- Verify network connection to Neon database
- Check the script output for specific errors

## Support 💬

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Render deployment logs
2. Check bot logs in Render
3. Verify database connection
4. Test GitHub image URLs directly
