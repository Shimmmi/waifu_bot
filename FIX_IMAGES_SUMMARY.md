# Image Issues - Fixed! 🖼️

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Fallback Images Using DiceBear**
**Problem:** The `WAIFU_IMAGES` fallback array in `waifu_generator.py` still had old DiceBear URLs.

**Solution:** Updated fallback array to use GitHub-hosted Human race images:
```python
WAIFU_IMAGES = [
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shimmmi/waifu_bot/main/waifu-images/races/human/Human_1.jpeg",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shimmmi/waifu_bot/main/waifu-images/races/human/Human_2.jpeg",
    ...
]
```

### 2. **Improved Image Selection Logging**
**Problem:** No visibility into which images were being selected and why.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive logging to `get_waifu_image()`:
- ✅ Logs successful race-based image selection
- ⚠️ Warns when race not found in image database
- ⚠️ Warns when using fallback images
- Shows available race keys when lookup fails

---

## 📊 Current Status

### **New Waifus** (Summoned After Deploy)
- ✅ Will use GitHub-hosted images based on race
- ✅ All 8 races have 5 custom images each
- ✅ Images selected from: `https://github.com/Shimmmi/waifu_bot/tree/main/waifu-images/races/`

### **Old Waifus** (Created Before Fix)
- ❌ Still have old DiceBear URLs in database
- ⚠️ Will show placeholder 🎭 emoji in WebApp
- 🔧 **Need to run migration script to update**

---

## 🔧 Fix Old Waifus

You need to update existing waifus in the database with new GitHub image URLs.

### **Option 1: Python Migration Script (Recommended)**

1. **Edit** `update_images_production.bat`:
   ```batch
   set DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:YOUR_PASSWORD@ep-dry-unit-a6kx0mwq.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```

2. **Run** the batch file:
   ```cmd
   update_images_production.bat
   ```

This will:
- ✅ Update all existing waifus
- ✅ Assign GitHub images based on race
- ✅ Randomly select from 5 images per race

### **Option 2: Direct SQL (Neon SQL Editor)**

If you prefer SQL, you can run queries like:
```sql
-- Update Angel waifus
UPDATE waifu 
SET image_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shimmmi/waifu_bot/main/waifu-images/races/angel/Angel_1.jpeg'
WHERE race = 'Angel' AND (image_url IS NULL OR image_url LIKE '%dicebear%');

-- Update Human waifus  
UPDATE waifu 
SET image_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shimmmi/waifu_bot/main/waifu-images/races/human/Human_1.jpeg'
WHERE race = 'Human' AND (image_url IS NULL OR image_url LIKE '%dicebear%');

-- ... repeat for each race
```

## 🎯 How to Test

### **Test New Waifu Images:**
1. Wait for Render deploy to complete (~2-3 minutes)
2. Summon a new waifu in Telegram bot
3. Open waifu details in WebApp
4. Should show custom GitHub image based on race

### **Check Render Logs:**
Look for image selection logs:
```
✅ Selected Human image from race category: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...
✅ Selected Angel image from race category: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...
```

Or warnings if something's wrong:
```
⚠️  Race Dragon not found in WAIFU_IMAGES_BY_RACE (available: ['Human', 'Elf', ...])
⚠️  Using fallback image (no specific match found): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...
```

### **Verify Old Waifus After Migration:**
1. Run migration script
2. Open any old waifu in WebApp
3. Should now show GitHub image instead of 🎭

## 🖼️ Image Structure

Your GitHub repository has all images organized:

```
waifu-images/races/
├── angel/      (5 images) ✅
├── beast/      (5 images) ✅
├── demon/      (5 images) ✅
├── dragon/     (5 images) ✅
├── elf/        (5 images) ✅
├── fairy/      (5 images) ✅
├── human/      (5 images) ✅
└── vampire/    (5 images) ✅
```

**Total:** 40 custom images hosted on GitHub!

---

## 🔍 Debugging

### **If New Waifus Show Placeholder:**
1. Check Render logs after summoning
2. Look for image selection logs
3. Check if race name matches keys in `WAIFU_IMAGES_BY_RACE`
4. Verify GitHub images are accessible (check URLs in browser)

### **If Old Waifus Still Show Placeholder:**
1. Run migration script to update database
2. Check database directly to verify `image_url` was updated
3. Clear WebApp cache (close and reopen)

### **Quick Check Script:**
Run locally to see current database state:
```cmd
python check_waifu_images.py
```

This shows:
- Recent waifus and their image URLs
- Whether they use GitHub or DiceBear
- Which waifus need updating
